# VSCode Solidity Inspector â€¢ [![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unlicense-blue.svg?label=license)](https://github.com/PraneshASP/vscode-solidity-inspector/blob/main/LICENSE)

An extension for VSCode editor to inspect the Solidity smartcontracts and generate yul/asm outputs to inspect what's happening under-the-hood. Read 0age's [tweet](https://twitter.com/z0age/status/1578443876615929857), it is the inspiration for this extension.

> Note: This extension is not tested across multiple platforms yet.Only the contracts under foundry project are supported for now.

---

## Motivation:

0age ðŸ‘‘ dropped the optimization alpha in his tweet and when I tried it out for the first time it was really a cool trick. The tweet has the configuration for hardhat projects. But forge helps to do the same thing in a single command. So I thought instead of typing out the command for each contracts, it would be handy for the buildoors if there's an extension to inspect solidity contracts and generate low-level code for the contracts. The o/p generated is very useful for gas optimizations.

TL;DR, this is my first VSCode extension, so feel free to provide feedback as I know that there's a plenty of room for improvements, as always^^

### Features at a glances:

- Forge ir-optimized o/p generation for the current file.
- Forge ir-optimized o/p generation for the multiple files option via the context menu.
- Forge asm-optimized o/p generation for the current file.
- Forge asm-optimized o/p generation for the multiple files option via the context menu.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed in order to use this template. Please follow the links and instructions.

- [Foundry / Foundryup](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
  - This will install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`
  - You can test you've installed them right by running `forge --version` and get an output like: `forge 0.2.0 (f016135 2022-07-04T00:15:02.930499Z)`
  - To get the latest of each, just run `foundryup`

### Usage

The usage of this extension is straightforward. You can inspect the solidity contracts that are under the foundry project in two ways:

1. Select file(s) -> Right click -> `SolidityOptimizer: ir-optimize selected file(s)`
